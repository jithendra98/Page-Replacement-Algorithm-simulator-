## **📝 Usage Instructions**
⸻
1. Enter page reference string (space-separated integers)
2. Specify memory frame size
3. Click "Simulate"
4. Analyze comprehensive algorithm performance

## **🔍 Algorithm Deep Dive**
⸻
### **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**
- Replaces the oldest page in memory
- Simple implementation
- May not always optimize performance

### **LRU (Least Recently Used)**
- Removes the least recently accessed page
- More intelligent than FIFO
- Closer to optimal memory management

### **Optimal Page Replacement**
- Theoretically perfect algorithm
- Replaces page that won't be used longest
- Impossible to implement perfectly in real-world scenarios

## **🌈 Visualization Insights**
⸻
- Comparative bar charts of page faults
- Timeline tracking of cumulative page faults
- Color-coded performance representation

## **🚀 Future Enhancements**
⸻
- Implement additional page replacement algorithms
- Enhanced performance analytics
- Machine learning-based prediction models
- Cross-platform GUI improvements
